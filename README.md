# CIFAKE-Real-and-AI-Generated-differentiation
The CIFAKE project is a comprehensive effort to develop and implement techniques for distinguishing between AI-generated images and real images. This project leverages a combination of preprocessing techniques, feature extraction, machine learning, and deep learning models to accurately classify images.
